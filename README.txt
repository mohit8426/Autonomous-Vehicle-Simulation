# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates an autonomous vehicle navigating through a predefined path in a 3D environment. It integrates Python for pathfinding, C++ for vehicle dynamics, and MATLAB for data analysis and visualization.

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.x)
- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- MATLAB (R2020a or later)
- Unity (2020.3 LTS or later) - for 3D environment simulation (not covered in this README)
